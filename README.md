### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Erno and I'm currently studying software development in Joensuu, Finland.
- ğŸ‘€ I am very interested in SQL and databases.
- ğŸŒ± I am currently learning PostgreSQL, pgAdmin and Python.

My work so far has been mostly in finnish. I'll use english more often in the future.
